An implementation of [tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) in C,
featuring an AI powered by the [negamax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negamax) algorithm.

This program operates entirely in the terminal environment.
Below is its appearance as it awaits your next move:
```
 1 |  ×
 2 |     ○
 3 |
---+----------
      A  B  C
>
```

To execute a move, enter `[column][row]`. For example:
```
> a3
```

Press Ctrl-C to exit.
